            <hr>
			<div>
				<p>We would like to propose an idea that builds an app catered for anyone who plays video games. This app would have a complete and functional UI/UX that lets a user build a gaming portfolio of any games that they have played and share it with their family and friends.</br>

					</br>This app will help gamers keep track of their gaming history. The user would have a profile page that has a picture, name, bio, personal website link (for their social pages), and of course, the main course here, the video games that they have played. The app would have several features including but not limited to:</br></p>
					<ul>
						<li>Search up a game to add to profile</li>
						<li>Rate the game on a 10-point-scale or 5 star-scale</li>
						<li>Include percentage of game finished</li>
						<li>Review the game</li>
						<li>Pick the console used to play the game</li>
						<li>A top row of three games handpicked to be pinned</li>
					</ul>
				</p>
				<p>
					The front of this project will have a Material-UI inspired interface. We want the UI to be fluid and very easy to navigate through without any confusion. A profile picture, along with a bio, game count, and average rating will be at the top of the page, followed by the games played, which will be displayed by pictures of the game along with the title and rating beneath it. Tapping on the game will take you to a separate page where more details are given such as percentage completed, console info, written review etcâ€¦ You can also sort the reviews by review date, release date, or played date.</br>
					</br>The backend of this will probably be evenly distributed among javascript, css and html. Adding and removing games will be stored in Arraylists for efficiency but that could change and probably will depend on which data structure will handle all this info with most efficiency. We will need to use database implementations to store data for the app such as the number of games that have been reviewed, or the average rating of all games, and of course to store user info safely.
